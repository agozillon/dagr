The header-only DAGR library provides a DSL closer to OpenCL for users of Khronos SYCL. This is used by the SYCL port of the KFusion component of the [EPRSC Pamela SLAMBench project](http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/PAMELA/tools/SLAMBench/). Further details on DAGR are available [here](https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/dagr-a-dsl-for-legacy-opencl-codes-porting-slambench-kfusion-to-s) and in the following workshop paper:
